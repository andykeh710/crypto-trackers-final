# The Crypto Tracker

Welcome to the crypto currency price tracking app utilizing the MERN Stack. React is one of the most popular modern frontend JavaScript frameworks and this will be the foundation for building a larger and more complex project at Kingsland University.

MERN is the stack of choice for today’s web developers looking to move quickly, MERN stands for MongoDB, Express, React, and Node after the four key technologies that make up the stack.

I. MongoDB - document database
II. Express - Node.js web framework
III. React - a client-side JavaScript framework
IV. Node - the premier JavaScript web server

MERN is (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) where the frontend JavaScript framework is with React. Express and Node make up the middle application tier allowing a 3-tier architecture (frontend, backend, database) using JavaScript, JSON and database tier.

The top tier is React, a declarative JavaScript framework for creating dynamic client-side applications in HTML to build complex interfaces through components, connecting them to data on the backend server, and render as HTML.
React’s ability to handle stateful, data-driven interfaces utilizing minimal code with the desired traits from a modern web framework including support for forms, error handling, events, lists, and so much more.

Express the next level down is a server-side application framework running inside a Node server considered to be a fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for Node with powerful models for URL routing handling HTTP request and responses by making XML HTTP Request, GET, and POST from the React front-end connecting to Express functions that power the application. This combination means JSON data flows naturally from front to back, making it fast and reasonable to debug. Those functions in turn use MongoDB’s Node drivers via callbacks for using Promises to access and update data in the MongoDB database.
If the web application stores any data while working with React, the JSON documents created in the React front end can be sent to the Express server, where they can be processed and stored directly in MongoDB for later retrieval.

The root of the MERN stack is MongoDB the document designed to store JSON data natively and everything from its command line interface to its query language built on JSON and JavaScript. MongoDB works with Node storing, manipulating, and representing JSON data at every tier of the application. Express and React make the JavaScript/JSON application full stack.

## Trusted by industry leaders

Matthew Tan
CEO, Etherscan

“The CoinGecko data market APIs are a set of robust APIs that developers can use to not only enhance their existing apps and services but also to build advanced crypto market apps. The team is also responsive to feedback and the occasions that we did these were quickly implemented into their api services.”

Kosala
CEO, MyEtherwallet

“Being in crypto space, our users expect us to provide the best service in the space. This includes having streaming crypto prices, price charts based on different time variations and providing these thousands of data points in a fast and secure manner. This is why MEW use coingecko as they are the best in the cryptospace for all crypto pricing API needs.”

Taylor Monahan
CEO, MyCrypto

“CoinGecko is one of our favorite teams in this space and using their API has been a huge improvement for our new beta.mycrypto.com. There are few reliable sources of this information and CoinGecko's data is extensive and easy to implement.”

The MERN Stack like other web stacks allows the ability to build any project although it’s ideally suited for cases that are JSON-heavy, cloud-native, and that have dynamic web interfaces.

## The technologies for the front end are as follows

• React
I. React creates an interactive UI with design simple views for each state in the application, efficiently update and render just the right components when the data changes. Declarative views make the code more predictable and easier to debug.

• React-Dom
II. A package that provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of the app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if needed.

• React-Scripts
III. A set of scripts from the create-react-app starter pack. That helps kick off projects without configuring and sets up the development environment and starts a server, as well as hot module reloading.

• Axios
IV. A library that helps make http requests to external resources. In React applications that need to retrieve data from external APIs so it can be displayed in our web pages. After retrieving the data and add it to the state, so it's ready to be used by the application.
(React, 2021)

## The technologies we use for the Back end are as follows

## MongoDB with key features

I. Documents: The Records in a Document Database
II. Collections: Grouping Documents
III. Replica Sets: Ensuring High Availability
IV. Sharding: Scalability to Handle Massive Data Growth
V. Indexes: Improving Query Speed
VI. Aggregation Pipelines: Fast Data Flows
VII. Programming Languages: Does MongoDB Speak Your Language?
VIII. MongoDB Cloud
